# Godot Mod Manager
This mod manager is built to allow players of your game to easily create mods on top of it.

Main Features
- Separation of data and behaviours to allow mods to override variable values
- Ability for mods to override data, images, music, and scenes, and to extend scripts
- The possibility of hot reloading to allow mod changes to affect the game without restarting it
- Mod dependency handling and switching them on and off in game

* Note this is still a work in progress. Not all functionality has been implemented
