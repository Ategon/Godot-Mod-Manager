# Godot Mod Manager
* Note this is still a work in progress. Will not work out of the box yet
* The mod manager will fully work when version 1.0 is released (you can see everything left in the issues tab)
* Feel free to join the discord or submit pull requests if you want to help

This mod manager is built to allow players of your game to easily create mods on top of it.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Ategon/Godot-Mod-Manager/wiki) for instructions to add the GMM to your game or on how to make mods

Everything is crafted to allow people who have pretty much no coding experience to still be able to make a mod to change images, music, or variables, or add new content using things you define.
In addition to this though it still retains the ability for people to go wild with code modding

Main Features
- Separation of data and behaviours to allow mods to override variable values
- Ability for mods to override data, images, music, and scenes, and to extend scripts
- The possibility of hot reloading to allow mod changes to affect the game without restarting it
- Mod dependency handling and switching them on and off in game

Some of the features (such as the separation of data) are only usable if the manager is integrated into the game but it is still usable on a game without regular mod support
